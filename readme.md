I created a grid page of products taken from the API, and displayed them through REACT.
I added a filter option by a search field - dynamic without scrolling pages.
After the customer clicks on the purchase button - of a particular product - the product is added to the shopping cart.
By clicking on the shopping cart, the customer can view all the products he has chosen on the same page.
By clicking on the shopping cart, the customer can view all the products he has chosen. On that page there is a "pay" button - which takes the customer to another
page where he enters his details and as soon as he clicks submit two emails are sent
One to the customer to update him that the order was placed successfully with Order summary, and the other to us with the customer's details.
